Tech Task solution is in the folder Broadridge
The project also contains the benchmark tests and unit tests.
The Benchmark tests is a list of beatles' song, it is too short to be meaningful but I have not had much time available to test "Moby Dick".

I evaluated different options using concurrent dictionary, caching is not the best, use simple addorupdate works, tryAdd and tryUpdate is faster.
