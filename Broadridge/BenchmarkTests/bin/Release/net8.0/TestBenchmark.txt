To lead a better life, I need my love to be here

[Verse 1]
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

[Verse 2]
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Pre-Chorus]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me, I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

[Chorus]
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

[Pre-Chorus]

To lead a better life, I need my love to be here

[Verse 1]
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

[Verse 2]
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Pre-Chorus]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me, I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

[Chorus]
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

[Pre-Chorus]

And if she's beside me, I know I need never care

To lead a better life, I need my love to be here

[Verse 1]
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

[Verse 2]
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Pre-Chorus]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me, I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

[Chorus]
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

[Pre-Chorus]

And if she's beside me, I know I need never care

To lead a better life, I need my love to be here

[Verse 1]
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

[Verse 2]
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Pre-Chorus]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me, I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

[Chorus]
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

[Pre-Chorus]

And if she's beside me, I know I need never care

To lead a better life, I need my love to be here

[Verse 1]
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

[Verse 2]
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Pre-Chorus]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me, I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

[Chorus]
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

[Pre-Chorus]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me, I know I need never care

To lead a better life, I need my love to be here

[Verse 1]
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

[Verse 2]
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Pre-Chorus]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me, I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

[Chorus]
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

[Pre-Chorus]

And if she's beside me, I know I need never care

To lead a better life, I need my love to be here

[Verse 1]
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

[Verse 2]
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Pre-Chorus]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me, I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

[Chorus]
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

[Pre-Chorus]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me, I know I need never care

And in the evening, she still sings it with the band

To lead a better life, I need my love to be here

[Verse 1]
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

[Verse 2]
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Pre-Chorus]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me, I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

[Chorus]
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

[Pre-Chorus]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me, I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
